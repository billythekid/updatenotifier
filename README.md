# Update Notifier plugin for Craft CMS

Plugin to let you know if your CMS/plugins need updated from your own external tools, without having to log in to your dashboard.

## Installation

To install Update Notifier, follow these steps:

1. Download & unzip the file and place the `updatenotifier` directory into your `craft/plugins` directory
2.  -OR- do a `git clone https://github.com/billythekid/updatenotifier.git` directly into your `craft/plugins` folder.  You can then update it with `git pull`
3.  -OR- install with Composer via `composer require billythekid/updatenotifier`
4. Install plugin in the Craft Control Panel under Settings > Plugins
5. The plugin folder should be named `updatenotifier` for Craft to see it.  GitHub recently started appending `-master` (the branch name) to the name of the folder for zip file downloads.

Update Notifier works on Craft 2.4.x and Craft 2.5.x.

## Update Notifier Overview

This plugin allows you to check if your Craft CMS install (and plugins) have pending updates, without having to log in to your dashboard.

## Configuring Update Notifier

There are a couple of settings you'll need to change before using this plugin. 

**Restrict access to a specific domain**

If you only want a specific web tool to access this tool, you should input the domain here. 
(This sets up a Access-Control-Allow-Origin value, as well as does some checks on the referrer in the code)
Leave this field blank if you want to be able to use this tool from anywhere.

**Secret key**

This is a required field and is used to verify that the request is coming from you. Only requests that have this key in them will be allowed to access the checks.

## Using Update Notifier

This plugin is a simple wrapper for the core Craft code to check for updates. It returns the updates as a JSON response for you to use in your apps however you want. Simply make a POST request to the URL given in the plugin's settings page, with the parameters shown.

* Key: **updatenotifierkey**
* Value: **33a6306c-a1e7-2656-4daa-76689d017c36** (for example)

* Key: **action** 
* Value: **UpdateNotifier/getUpdates** 

## Example Code

I've just stuck some jQuery code on here because everybody knows how to use jQuery right.

Obviously if you use Axios or Guzzle or cURL, you can adjust to suit. This isn't particularly useful codeâ€¦

```js
$.post('https://example.com', {
    updatenotifierkey: '33a6306c-a1e7-2656-4daa-76689d017c36',
    action: 'UpdateNotifier/getUpdates'
}, function (response) {
    console.log(response.app);
    console.log(response.plugins);
});
```
Here's a screenshot of the sort of structure that you may get back:

You can use this JSON response however you want.
